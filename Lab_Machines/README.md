## Overview & Goal:
To research and build two very strong machines for HSRN general-purpose lab experiments.

## Considerations:
No water cooling - we do not want to have to worry about leaks or maintenance. We also need very fast network cards.

## Intel Machine Specs:
- Chassis: Corsair 7000D AIRFLOW
- Storage & Boot Drives: Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus (2x4TB)
- CPU: Intel Core i9-13900K
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4090 FE
- PSU: Corsair AX1600i 1600W 80+ Titanium
- Motherboard: Gigabyte Z790 AORUS ELITE
- Heat sink: Noctua NH-D15
- RAM: G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo DDR5-6000 (4x32GB) 
- Network Card: -
