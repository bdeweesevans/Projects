## Overview:
CarsonDiningMenu gathers menu HTML from the University of Oregonâ€™s Carson dining hall website and publishes a daily graphic of the menu items to Instagram.

## Ending:
The University of Oregon eventually stopped publishing their menu in plain-text HTML and changed to posting a scheduled menu as a PDF.
