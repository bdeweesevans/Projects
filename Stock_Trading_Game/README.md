## Overview:
This project aims to deliver a child-friendly stock trading experience through simulating market events.

## Notes:
The articles are generated using GPT, as well as the images. Each API call to create them is accompanied by a sentiment value, so that they correspond. This sentiment value is supposed to impact the price of the equity it is attached to. Deno, Tailwind, & Google OAuth were used. It is more of proof of concept project.
